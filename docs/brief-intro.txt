DevAssistant is developer's best friend (right after coffee).

DevAssistant (http://devassistant.org) can help you with creating and setting up basic projects
in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc. There are four main
types of functionality provided:

- ``da create`` - create new project from scratch
- ``da tweak`` - work with local existing project (e.g. import it to Eclipse, register on GitHub)
- ``da prepare`` - prepare development environment for an upstream project
- ``da extras`` - perform a custom task not related to a specific project

The first three of these have shortcuts for faster use: "create" can be shortened as "crt",
"tweak" as "twk", "prepare" as "prep" and "extras" as "extra".

DevAssistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical
structure. E.g. you can run::

   $ da create python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
   $ da create python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
   $ da create ruby rails -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir

DevAssistant also allows you to work with a previously created project, for example
import it to Eclipse::

   $ da tweak eclipse # run in project dir or use -p to specify path

With DevAssistant, you can also prepare environment for developing upstream projects -
either using project-specific assistants or using "custom" assistant for arbitrary projects
(even those not created by DevAssistant)::

   $ da prepare custom custom -u scm_url

**Warning:** The ``custom`` assistant executes custom pieces of code from
``.devassistant`` file of the project. Therefore you have to be extra careful
and use this **only with projects whose authors you trust**.

Last but not least, DevAssistant allows you to perform arbitrary tasks not related to a specific
project::

   $ da extras <TODO:NOTHING YET>
