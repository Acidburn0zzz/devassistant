The devassistant project is a helper for all developers using (not-only) Fedora. It helps with creating and setting up basic projects in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc.
 
Devassistant provides three binaries with three different purposes:

- ``devassistant`` - create new project from scratch
- ``devassistant-modify`` - take local project and do something with it (e.g. import it to Eclipse)
- ``devassistant-prepare`` - prepare development environment for a project from remote source control and checkout the source

Devassistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure. E.g. you can run::

   $ devassistant python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
   $ devassistant python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
   $ devassistant java jsf -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir

Devassistant also allows you to work with a previously created project, for example import it to Eclipse::

   $ devassistant-modify eclipse # run in project dir or use -p to specify path

Last but not least, devassistant allows you to check out a project from SCM (either previously created by devassistant with "custom" assistant or a specific project, assuming that you have the individual assistant for it)::

   $ devassistant-prepare custom ./devassistant-prepare.py custom -u scm_url
